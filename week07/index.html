  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Properties can be added to functions in much the same way they can be added to objects.</li>
    <li>Memoization can be used to cache the results of commonly calculated values.</li>
    <li>IIFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. A convinient way to create temporary variables and limit variable scope. Can be useful for initializing code.</li>
    <li>Functions can redefine/rewrite themselves. Useful to have one function that can check browser compatability, then rewrite iteself to only have the code needed for that specific setup.
      <!--
      <ul>
        <li>This functionality gave me the idea to make a webpage with abutton that calls a function that rewrites itself each time it is called, building up the webpage with each buttonpress.</li>
        <li>I put togeter a prototype which can be seen <a href="function-fun/index.html">here</a></li>
      </ul>-->
    </li>
    <li>Recursive functions are able to call themselves. Useful when a complicated task can be broken down into repeated simple tasks.</li>
    <li>Callbacks allow the program to set a function cal asside and come back to it later.</li>
    <li>Ajax: Asynchronous JavaScript XML (although JSON files are used more than XML these days</li>
    <li>Fetch API is now used to implement Ajax</li>
  </ul>
