<body>
  <h1>Hello! Press the button:</h1>
  <button>Press Me</button>

  <p>I just found out that JavaScript functions can rewrite themselves.</p>
  <p>That blew my mind and gave me an idea...</p>
  <p>What if I made a page that had nothing but a button...</p>
  <p>and every time you click the button, </p>


  <script src="./script.js" onclick="fun()"></script>
</body>
