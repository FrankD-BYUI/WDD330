    <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja Ch2-4</h2>
    <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Comments: Single line comments use "//" and multi-line comments start with "/*" and end with "*/".</li>
      <li>End each line with a semicolon to avoid issues.</li>
      <li>var, let, and const are used to declare variables. var is no longer used in ES6.</li>
      <li>let and const are limited in scope to the block it is delcared in.</li>
      <li>Variable naming rules: "Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them."</li>
      <li>Template Literals use the " ` " character and allow you to include JavaScript code in within the string (just like double quotes in PHP). Example: `Hello ${ name }!`;</li>
      <li>Map is a data structure that contains a list of name value pairs. Represented as Map { name => 'Value" }</li>
      <li>Define a function like this: function hello(){ //body of function }</li>
      <li>Define an annonymous function expression like this: const hello = function() { //body of function };</li>
      <li>Define a named function expression like this: const hello = function howdy() { //body of function };</li>
      <li>When you assign a function to a varable, you need the () after the variable name when you want to call it.</li>
      <li>Arguments are passed in with a function call, parameters are the internal variable names inside a function.</li>
      <li>Callback allows you to pass a function as an argument to another function. Remember how functions can be stored in variables? It's basically an extension of that idea.</li>
    </ul>
