  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transforms are a way to move or otherwise manipulate how an element shows up on the page using CSS.</li>
    <li>Translate is used to move an element. Translating an element does not affect the position of anything else on the page.</li>
    <li>Scale is a way to change the sizing of an element on the page.</li>
    <li>Rotate allows you to rotate an element.</li>
    <li>Transforms are applied in the order they are listing. Changing the order changes the final result.</li>
    <li>Transition is a way to have an element gradually change form one style to another</li>
    <li>Animations are like transitions, but you can set them up with keyframes.</li>
    <li>Canvas allows you to create a space to draw on (like a real life canvas)</li>
    <li>Canvas drawing can be exported as images.</li>
    <li>Once you finish creating a canvas object, it can no longer be modified.</li>
    <li>SVG is a vector based image format that uses XML.</li>
    <li>SVG can be easily edited and manipulated by CSS and JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
